Hi! I'm Chris, a recent graduate of MakerSquare, Los Angeles.

My educational background is in mechanical engineering, but in the past year I've dived into web development.  I've contributed to several full stack apps, with the majority of my time spent on the front end with Angular.js.  I'm currently learning React.js and Redux and am looking forward to demonstrating those skills as well!

I use this site to showcase some of my recent [projects](cse25.github.io/projects).  Feel free to contact me via [email](mailto:chrisjc25@gmail.com).  You can also find links to my GitHub and LinkedIn in the footer.
