Hi! I'm Chris, a passionate software engineer located in Los Angeles.

My background is in mechanical engineering, but in the past two years I've become fully immersed in web development.  Since April of 2016, I've developed four full stack apps with technologies such as React, Redux, Angular, Node, Express, MySQL, and MongoDB. 

I use this site to showcase my recent [projects](/projects).  Feel free to contact me via [email](mailto:chrisjc25@gmail.com).  You can also find links to my GitHub and LinkedIn below.
