Hi! I'm Chris, a passionate software engineer located in Los Angeles.

My background is in mechanical engineering, but in the past year I've become immersed in web development.  Since April, I've developed four full stack apps using a variety of technologies such as React, Redux, Angular, Node, Express, MySQL, and MongoDB. 

I use this site to showcase my recent [projects](cse25.github.io/projects).  Feel free to contact me via [email](mailto:chrisjc25@gmail.com).  You can also find links to my GitHub and LinkedIn below.
