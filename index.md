Hi! I'm Chris, a recent graduate of MakerSquare, Los Angeles.

My background is in mechanical engineering, but in the past year I've become immersed in web development.  Since April, I've developed three full stack apps, with the majority of my time spent on the front end with Angular.js.  I'm currently learning React.js and Redux and am looking forward to demonstrating those skills here as well!

I use this site to showcase my recent [projects](cse25.github.io/projects).  Feel free to contact me via [email](mailto:chrisjc25@gmail.com).  You can also find links to my GitHub and LinkedIn down below.
